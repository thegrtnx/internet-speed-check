# Internet Speed Checker

This is a [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) project created by [`Abolade Greatness`](https://github.com/thegrtnx) helping you check a user internet upload and download speed in real-time.

## üëå Requirement

- Node.js should be installed in your system. If not, you can download and install from [`Node.js Website`](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## üîß Installation

Install the required modules:

```bash
npm install

```

## ‚è≤Ô∏è Execute

- To compile :

```bash
 npm run build

```

- To compile and start the application:

```bash
 npm start

```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Learn More

- Start: This script runs both the build (compilation) and start (execution) steps. It uses the;

```bash
npm run build

```

to compile TypeScript files with [tsc], and then it runs the compiled JavaScript file using [`node dist/index.js`].

- Build: This script simply runs the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile your TypeScript files.
